    "# Keras tutorial - the Happy House\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first assignment of week 2. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. \n",
    "2. See how you can in a couple of hours build a deep learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we using Keras? Keras was developed to enable deep learning engineers to build and experiment with different models very quickly. Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level framework than Python, Keras is an even higher-level framework and provides additional abstractions. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some very complex models that you can implement in TensorFlow but not (without more difficulty) in Keras. That being said, Keras will work fine for many common models. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll work on the \"Happy House\" problem, which we'll explain below. Let's load the required packages and solve the problem of the Happy House!"

In other words, during each step of forward propagation, we are just writing the latest value in the commputation into the same variable `X`. The only exception was `X_input`, which we kept separate and did not overwrite, since we needed it at the end to create the Keras model instance (`model = Model(inputs = X_input, ...)` above). \n",

We suggest that you start by implementing a model using the architecture we suggest, and run through the rest of this assignment using that as your initial model. But after that, come back and take initiative to try out other model architectures. For example, you might take inspiration from the model above, but then vary the network architecture and hyperparameters however you wish. You can also use other functions such as `AveragePooling2D()`, `GlobalMaxPooling2D()`, `Dropout()`. \n",
